## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Future Upgrades

- **Tracking Points Increase**: Currently, we haven't tested if overall credits increase. From the AI creations I did manually, it did not affect overall credits. They may be calculated later.
- **Real-Time Discord Chat Connection**: This feature will enhance human-like interaction. I plan to implement this as soon as possible.
- **Future Maintenance**: I cannot guarantee ongoing updates for this project. Please feel free to fork it and add more features!
